RAM = [M, M-1, 0, 1]

1:  LOD  R1, 0          # Loads M into R1
2:  LOD  R0, 2          # Loads 0 into R0
3:  LOD  R3, 3          # Loads 1 into R3
4:  SUB  R2, R1, R3     # Subtracts 1 from M and puts value in R2
5:  CPZ  R2             # Checks if M-1 is 0; if so, done
6:  BEQ  4        
7:  ADD  R0, R0, R1     #
8:  SUB  R2, R2, R3     # ^ Carry out multiplication

# Need to store the content in R0 somewhere else so that it can be called back to be multiplied to the next number (-1)

9:  JMP -*              # Repeat multiplication process
10: HLT                 # Stops the SVM
