RAM = [M, N]


1:  LOD  R1, 0          # Loads M into R1     
2:  LOD  R2, 1          # Loads N into R2
3:  CMP  R1, R2         # Sets PSW to R1-R2                             
4:  BLT  3              # Checks if R1 < R2
5:  SUB  R1, R1, R2     # Subtracts N from M
6:  JMP  -3             # Repeats the subtraction process until 0 is reached
7:  LOD  R0, R1         # Puts remainder in R0
8:  HLT                 # Stops the SVM
