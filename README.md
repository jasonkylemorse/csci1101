Computer Science 1
==================

This repository contains problem set assignments from CSCI1101 - Computer Science 1 (Spring 2013).

#####Problem Set 1 (Basics)
* `problemset1.py` – Returns ‘Hello World!’. Returns the golden ratio. Returns the length of a right triangle’s hypotenuse given a base and height. Draws a yellow circle.

#####Problem Set 2 (Drawing Using stddraw Library)
* `ring.py` – Draws a ring of given coordinates, radius, width, and color. </li>
* `ringInBounds.py` – Draws a ring of given parameters only if it lies completely within the 1 by 1 drawing area. </li>
* `randomRings.py` – Generates rings of random color, size, width, radius, and location. 
* `rowOfRings.py` – Draws a given amount of rings in a row that fit within the viewing area. 
* `diamonds.py` – Draws a given amount of squares in a diagonal row that fit within the viewing area. 
* `ringTiling.py` – Draws a tessellation of rings that fit within the viewing area. 

#####Problem Set 3 (Animation & Loops)
* `tumble.py` – Draws an animation of a block falling across the viewing area. 
* `approxPi.py` – Generates a given number of random points in one quadrant of a unit circle to form a ratio that approximates the value of pi. 

#####Problem Set 4 (Lists)
* `mergeSort.py` – Sorts a disorganized list into ascending order. Merges two lists and sorts the result into ascending order. 
* `change.py` – Given an amount of money and a list of available coin types, determines how many of each coin type are needed to reach the amount using the least number of coins possible.
* `sieve.py` – Given a list, picks out the prime numbers. 

#####Problem Set 5 (Binary Search Trees & Simple Virtual Machines)
* `maxDepth.py` – Determines the depth of a binary search tree. 
* `svm.py` – Simple virtual machine that simulates the basic workings of a computer. 

#####Problem Set 6 (Audio)
* `sawToothA4.py` – Generates a piece of audio represented by a jagged graph. 
* `fade.py` – Causes a given piece of audio to slowly fade. 
* `sinNote.py` -  Generates a piece of audio represented by a sin wave graph.

#####Problem Set 7 (Two Dimensional Arrays)
* `pileUp.py` – Given certain dimensions, a drawing area is created and, when clicked, a block will fall to the bottom at a random location. Blocks pile up if they fall in the same column and the game stops when a pile reaches the top of the viewing area. 

#####Problem Set 8 (Two Dimensional Arrays and Recursive Trial & Error)
* `sudoku.py` – Given a Sudoku board, checks the validity and solves the puzzle. 

#####Problem Set 9 (Markov Models)
* `markov.py` – Given input text, performs an analysis based on a given degree and determines the most common sequence of letters, generating a new block of text. 

#####Problem Set 10 (Finite State Machines)
* `runFSM.py` & `ribosome.py` - Program that uses a finite state machine to walk through a sequence of nucleotides. It will convert groups of three into the corresponding amino acid.
